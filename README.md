"# fifty_projects_collection"

This is a collection of the 50 projects from Brad Traversy's program that I built using only javascript, css, and html (no frameworks.)
I'm going to fine-tune them and upload them, which should be at a rate of about one a day anyway with my work schedule.
The projects will get increasingly more difficult as the numbers go up.
